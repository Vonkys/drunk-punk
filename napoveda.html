<h1>Help – 🎮 Drunk Punk</h1>
<div class="faq">

  <div class="q">🧑‍🌾 How do I start farming?</div>
  <div class="a">Go to the "Grow Sh*t" section. First, open the shop (🛒 button), pick a seed (like wheat 🌾 or potatoes 🥔), and click "Buy." Then tap any free field tile to plant it. After a timer, the crop is ready to harvest. Easy.</div>

  <div class="q">🌾 What can I grow?</div>
  <div class="a">You can grow wheat, potatoes, barley, hops, grapes, fruits like apples, plums, and apricots. Each has a use – food, alcohol, or ingredients for more complex stuff.</div>

  <div class="q">🐄 How do animals work?</div>
  <div class="a">Buy animals in the Coop section. They need 1 wheat 🌾 every hour or they die. If you have auto-feed active (with Pi tokens), they won't starve. Animals produce items (eggs, milk, wool) after a few hours. Collect and use or sell.</div>

  <div class="q">🧺 Do products collect themselves?</div>
  <div class="a">Nope. Every product must be collected manually – nothing happens if you just stare at it. But hey, the dev is considering automation in the future (maybe for in-game tokens). So keep an eye on updates!</div>

  <div class="q">💩 Why is there poop?</div>
  <div class="a">Animals poop. If you don't clean it, they die. Clean the crap often. It’s farm life, baby.</div>

  <div class="q">🍺 How do I brew beer?</div>
  <div class="a">Buy a beer vat and boiler. You need wheat 🌾, hops 🍃 and time ⏳. First you ferment, then boil. Each beer has its own requirements.</div>

  <div class="q">🍷 How do I make wine?</div>
  <div class="a">Buy a wine press and vat. You need grapes 🍇 or other fruits and time ⏳. Press first, then ferment. Voilà – wine.</div>

  <div class="q">🔥 How do I distill spirits?</div>
  <div class="a">Get a distiller ⚗, fruit and time. First ferment the fruit, then distill it. Each spirit (rum, slivovitz, peach brandy) needs different mash.</div>

  <div class="q">💸 How do I earn money?</div>
  <div class="a">Sell your stuff in the Market or the Pub. You can sell items one by one, or do quests for bigger rewards. Don’t hoard – trade smart!</div>

  <div class="q">🧻 How does freeze feeding work?</div>
  <div class="a">Pay 1 Pi to freeze animal food for 24 hours. That means animals won't need wheat and won’t die. Buy peace of mind.</div>

  <div class="q">🥔 What does the fryer do?</div>
  <div class="a">Turns potatoes 🥔 into fries 🍟. Just buy the fryer and boom – you’re a grease king.</div>

  <div class="q">📈 How does XP work?</div>
  <div class="a">Every action gives XP: planting, harvesting, crafting, collecting animal products, fulfilling quests. More actions = more XP = flex on the leaderboard.</div>

  <div class="q">🪙 What are Pi Tokens for?</div>
  <div class="a">Use Pi to buy boosts: freeze feeding, expand field space, or buy game tokens in the Wallet. You earn more Pi by being active or through login rewards.</div>

  <div class="q">📅 What’s the daily login?</div>
  <div class="a">Click the Daily Login button every day to mark your streak. 30 days = reward in Pi. Miss a day? Back to day 1.</div>

  <div class="q">🤔 What’s coming next?</div>
  <div class="a">Tutorials, Cafeteria, Bakery, Dairy, Pizzeria, Mojitos, Weddings, and a Hotel for the elite! Stay tuned!</div>

  <div class="q">💡 Pro tips?</div>
  <div class="a">- Always have wheat planted. You’ll need tons.<br>
    - Use your animals! They're the backbone.<br>
    - Quests = quick cash.<br>
    - Don’t forget to poop-scoop 💩.</div>

  <div class="q">❓ Something broke?</div>
  <div class="a">Refresh the page. Still bugged? Contact the dev. Or take a shot 🥃 and try again.</div>

  <div class="q">🎯 Final goal?</div>
  <div class="a">Just chill and build your farming & booze empire. It’s a drunk life.</div>
